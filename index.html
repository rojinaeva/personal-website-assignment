                <h1>Mission</h1>
                <p>A mission statement articulates a company's purpose. It announces to the world at large why your
                    company exists. Every business should have a mission statement as a way of unifying the
                    organization.</p>

                <h1>Vission</h1>
                <p>A vision statement for a company or organization focuses on the potential inherent in the company's
                    future; its about what they intend to be. While a vision statement might contain references to how
                    the company intends to make that future into a reality.

                    sections follow the SMART goals guidelines. As a reminder, SMART is the acronym for Specific,
                    Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-based</p>

            <h1>Develop without limits</h1>
            <p>When you read any great piece of writing, you know it. You get lost in the words, whether it is a classic
                novel from Steinbeck or an article in The New York Times. Those pieces catch our attention because of
                the way the author develops ideas or characters with the written word. </p>
